-- Update: 06/27/2018
    -- Added condition REG.regStatus = 1 (to prevent graduated students from shwing up in result set)
-- Update: 06/04/2018
    -- Now displays students for classes where the teacher is listed as a shared instructor
    -- Changed all AND NOT isActive = 0 to AND isActive = 1
    -- Simplified table/column names
    -- Changed structure of "Last Time Clocked" column from nested IF to CASE statement
       -- Also changed criteria for Absent status to a student who has not clocked in when the class has been in session for an hour
       -- Now using 'clockedStatus' instead of counting daily clockpunches to determine if a student is present
    -- Sorted by class names, ascending start times
    
-- Update: 03/16/2017 by Zachary Bene
    -- switched studentId with idNumber
-- Attendance Sense for Teacher Start Screens
-- The purpose of this query is to show
    -- Current attendance status of each student
    -- Filtered by teacher for the teacher start page
